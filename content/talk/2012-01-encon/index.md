summary:
abstract: "We have developed a computational framework using random matrix theory and free probability to study the problem of calculating the density of states in disordered organic semiconductors. Using free probability theory, we approximate the density of states by the free convolution of two matrix ensembles formed by decomposing the Hamiltonian ensemble of the disordered system. Our framework allows us to calculate the error in this approximation using asymptotic moment expansions, with coefficients that have combinatorial interpretations as weighted paths of closed loops in Hilbert space. We show how the error, like the free convolution itself, can be calculated without explicit diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. We apply our theory to Hamiltonians for one-dimensional tight binding models with Gaussian and semicircular site disorder. We find that the particular choice of decomposition crucially determines the accuracy of the resultant density of states.
From a partitioning of the Hamiltonian into diagonal and off-diagonal components, free convolution produces an approximate density of states which is correct to the eighth moment. This allows us to explain the accuracy of mean field theories such as the coherent potential approximation, as well as the results of isotropic entanglement theory."
