summary:
abstract: "A two-pronged computational study using both atomistic calculations
and analytic models has revealed insights into how disorder affects
the electrical and optical properties of organic semiconductors.
First, the effects of thermal fluctuations and impurity doping in the
exciton band structure of room temperature metal-free phthalocyanine
(H2Pc) crystals was studied. Thermodynamically accessible microstates
were sampled explicitly from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations,
and the structure of excitonic states were determined using a hybrid
quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations using
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The density of
states shows evidence of thermally-induced dynamical localization due
to collective interactions beyond the nearest neighbor level. Second,
disorder-induced localization transitions in tight binding Anderson
models were revisited. Using newly developed notions of partial
freeness in random matrices, the density of states can be approximated
accurately with known error bounds and without requiring explicit
calculation of eigenvectors. An accurate approximation was found that
reproduces the first seven moments of the density of states
accurately, with an error that grows only linearly with the number of
neighbors on a lattice."
