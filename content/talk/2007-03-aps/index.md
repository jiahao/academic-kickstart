title: "Representing molecules as atomic-scale electrical circuits with fluctuating-charge models"
event: 2007 APS March Meeting
event_url: http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR07/Session/P19
location: Colorado Convention Center
address:
  street: 700 14th Street
  city: Denver
  region: Colorado
  postcode: 80202
  country: US
summary:
abstract: "Fluctuating-charge models (FCMs), also known as chemical potential equilibration models, can describe charge transfer in molecular mechanics (MM). Examples of FCMs are QEq [1], \textit{fluc}-q (FQ) [2], and our recently proposed PE-CC-QVB2 [3] and QTPIE [4]. FCMs describe the accumulation and depletion of atomic charges with electronegativities and chemical hardnesses. We show that this description of atoms maps molecular systems onto electrical circuits. Unlike other models [1, 2], our models correctly model a diatomic molecule in the dissociation limit; we explain how this is reflected in its circuit representation. FCMs hence establish a new connection between the statistical mechanics of molecular electronic structure [5] and classical circuit theory."
