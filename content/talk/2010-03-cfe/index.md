summary:
abstract: "How do I compare calculations to experiment, and how good can I get my  numbers?  Last time some of the theoretical tools behind computational  chemistry were introduced.  Now we will focus on how we can use them,  and how they relate to experiment.  We will start off by a brief  discussion of current excited state methods, how well you can trust  them, and what experiments do they line up with?  These ideas will then  be applied to an example system of H2PC/PTCBI. "
