summary:
abstract: "Charge carriers in bulk heterojunction solar cells are formed at phase
boundaries whose morphologies are poorly understood, and their
transport may be influenced by disorder-induced effects such as
dynamical localization or ergodicity breaking. This talk summarizes
our initial studies of how disorder affects the electrical and optical
properties of organic semiconductors. First, we apply our newly
developed notions of partial freeness in random matrices[1] to study
disorder-induced localization in the tight binding Anderson model. The
density of states can be approximated with great accuracy without
solving for the eigenvectors explicitly. In one dimension, the error
is small and independent of the noise strength, and also scales
linearly with the number of nearest neighbors in more general
lattices. Second, we studied thermal fluctuations in room temperature
metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) crystals as well as impurity doping
with zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc). Thermodynamically accessible
microstates were sampled explicit from all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations, and the structure of excitonic states were determined
using a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)
calculations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).
The density of states is distinctly asymmetric, with distinct
subpopulations in the tails. The blue-shifted tail is comprised
exclusively of excitonic states that are localized in at least two
dimensions, whereas the red-shifted tail has a much more diffuse,
delocalized stucture. Numerical evidence suggests that the unusual
electronic structure is produced by a new type of disorder-induced
localization phenomenon due to a collective interaction beyond the
nearest neighbor level."
