summary:
abstract: "Fluctuating-charge models are inexpensive methods for treating
polarization in classical molecular dynamics simulations [1] and are
integral to the construction of reactive force fields. [2] These
models appeal to chemical intuitions regarding electronegativities and
chemical hardnesses. In principle, fluctuating-charge models are also
capable of treating intermolecular charge transfer effects; however,
many charge models exaggerate charge transfer, predicting fractional
charge transfer even at infinite separation. [3] We describe an
alternative to the usual workaround of not allowing intermolecular
transfer, thus allowing practical simulations that incorporate both
intra- and intermolecular charge transfer effects. [4,5] Fixing the
long-range behavior of fluctuating-charge models has important
implications for the computation of electrostatic properties such as
dipole moments and polarizabilities. [6,7] We also present preliminary
results on extending fluctuating-charge models to model charge
transfer excitations."
