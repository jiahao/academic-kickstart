title: What does computer science have to offer computational science?
event: "CME 300: First Year Seminar Series"
event_url:
location: Shriram Center for Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering, Stanford University
address:
  street: 443 Via Ortega
  city: Stanford
  region: California
  postcode: 94305
  country: US
summary:
abstract: "Julia (julialang.org) is an emerging high level programming language for
technical computing. We introduce how Julia is designed to let users
write code that is flexible, expressive and fast. We discuss how a rich
type system and just in time compilation allow technical computations to
be expressed using low-cost abstractions that minimize computational
overhead."
