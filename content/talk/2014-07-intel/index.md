summary:
abstract: "In this talk, I will introduce the Julia programming language (http://julialang.org/) and provide a personal perspective on why it is ideally suited for serious numerical and data analytics work. Central to Julia's design are its rich support for data types and its novel multiple dispatch mechanism. When implemented with features like the use of just-in-time compilation and type inference to generate specialized methods on-the-fly, these core language features allow users to write high performance code with zero-cost (or very cheap) abstraction costs in many cases. I will give a few simple examples illustrating the rich interplay between carefully designed language features and their composition into elegant and expressive code."
