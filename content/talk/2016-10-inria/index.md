summary:
abstract: "I present Julia, a fast, dynamic, general purpose
programming language, and describe how it excels in technical
computing. The language design allows users to define types that not
only describe data, but also what can be done with data using
multimethods (multiple dispatch). The careful design choices behind
Julia allow users to express the intrinsically polymorphic nature of
technical computing, while at the same time enabling compiler
optimizations in cases where dispatch can be resolved statically. The
late binding nature of dynamic dispatch, combined with having much of
the base library written in Julia itself, also facilitates the
composition of functionality across multiple libraries, e.g. linear
algebra and automatic differentiation."
