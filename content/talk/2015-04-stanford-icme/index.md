summary:
abstract: "Random matrix theory has long been used to study the
spectral properties of physical systems, and has led to a rich
interplay between probability theory and physics.  Historically,
random matrices have been used to model physical systems with
random fluctuations, or systems whose eigenproblems were too difficult
to solve numerically. This talk explores applications of RMT to
the physics of disorder in organic semiconductors. Revisiting
the old problem of Anderson localization has shed new light on
the emerging field of free probability theory . I will discuss
the implications of free probabilistic ideas for finite-dimensional
random matrices, as well as some hypotheses about eigenvector
locality. Algorithms are available in the RandomMatrices.jl package
written for the Julia programming language."
