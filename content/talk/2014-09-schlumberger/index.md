summary:
abstract: "Julia is a young language designed specifically for technical computing, featuring a vibrant user and developer community, native parallel computing support, just in time compilation, a comprehensive core numerical library, a rich type system and an expressive generic function system featuring multiple dispatch. I will briefly introduce these features of the Julia language and give some examples of how language features like multimethods can be used to write expressive yet performant code for scientific computing applications. In many cases, it is possible to write Julia code as expressive as a pure mathematical formulation of a model, yet have the code execute with speeds comparable to hand-written C/C++ code. Julia thus presents an opportunity to prototype code rapidly and also deploy the same code for scalable production-level deployment.
