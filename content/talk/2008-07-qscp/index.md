summary:
abstract: "Of the available methods for treating polarization in classical molecular dynamics simulations, only fluctuating-charge models such as EEM, QEq, fluc-q and
CHARMM C22 can potentially describe both charge transfer and polarization.
However, these current models predict unphysical non-integer charge separation
at dissociation. Also, they predict dipole polarizabilities that are not correctly sizeextensive. Our QTPIE model is a modification of QEq that describes correct
charge transfer at dissociation limits for overall neutral systems. Here, we use
coplanar, linear water chains to show that unlike other fluctuating-charge models,
QTPIE predicts the correct direction of charge transfer. Also, we investigate the
origin of the super-linear scaling of the dipole polarizabilities, and show how
QTPIE can reproduce the correct scaling properties of the dipole polarizabilities
and dipole moments without a priori constraints on charge transfer. Unlike other
previously proposed solutions to this problem, we are able to retain a useful
treatment of intermolecular charge transfer. We also show that calculations in the
TINKER molecular mechanics package using QTPIE are about five times as
expensive as conventional fixed-charge calculations. Finally, we report on our
progress toward the development of a flexible water model that uses QTPIE to
capture both polarization and charge transfer effects."
