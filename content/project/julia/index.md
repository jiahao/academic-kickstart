I am a core contributor to the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
In addition to starting and running the [Julia Lab](https://julia.mit.edu)
at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu) from 2013---2017, I
have also made over 500 commits to
the core [Julia repository](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/graphs/contributors),
and authored over 80 Julia packages spread over the
[JuliaMatrices](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices),
[JuliaMath](https://github.com/JuliaMath),
[JuliaParallel](https://github.com/JuliaParallel),
[JuliaQuantum](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum),
[JuliaSparse](https://github.com/JuliaSparse),
[JuliaStats](https://github.com/JuliaStats),
and
[JuliaText](https://github.com/JuliaText)
organizations,
and also my [personal account](https://github.com/jiahao?tab=repositories&q=.jl).
I am also involved in
the [JuliaCN](https://github.com/JuliaCN) documentation translation efforts into Mandarin Chinese,
the [JuliaCon](https://github.com/JuliaCon) organizing committee (including
chairing the first three JuliaCons 2014---2016),
and broader outreach efforts through the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/)
nonprofit.
