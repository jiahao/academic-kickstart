abstract: "When I first learned about the Julia programming language at the beginning of 2012, I was skeptical about its ability to succeed. Writing a new programming language seemed like an exercise in hubris: Why did the world need yet another one, anyway? Yet after trying Julia, I quickly learned to embrace it."
