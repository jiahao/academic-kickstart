abstract: "This paper reviews the use of graphs as mathematical descriptions of social networks, and discusses in particular some properties of the commonly used random (Erd˝os-Rényi), small-world (Watts-Strogatz) and scale-free (power-law) models, with particular focus on the small-world model. The applications of such networks to epidemiology are then briefly outlined with some comments pertaining to the analysis of the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."
