abstract: "Polarization and charge transfer are important effects which are difficult to describe using conventional force fields. Charge equilibration models can include both of these effects in large-scale molecular simulations. However, these models behave incorrectly when bonds are broken, making it difficult to use them in the context of reactive force fields. We develop a new method for describing charge flow in molecules -- QTPIE. The QTPIE method is based on charge transfer variables (as opposed to atomic charges) and correctly treats asymptotic behavior near dissociation. It is also able to provide a realistic description of in-plane polarizabilities."
