abstract: "Fluctuating-charge models have been used to model polarization effects in molecular mechanics methods. However, they overestimate polarizabilities in large systems. Previous attempts to remedy this have been at the expense of forbidding intermolecular charge-transfer. Here, we investigate this lack of size-extensivity and show that the neglect of terms arising from charge conservation is partly responsible; these terms are also vital for maintaining the correct translational symmetries of the dipole moment and polarizability that classical electrostatic theory requires. Also, QTPIE demonstrates linear-scaling polarizabilities when coupling the external electric field in a manner that treats its potential as a perturbation of the atomic electronegativities. Thus for the first time, we have a fluctuating-charge model that predicts size-extensive dipole polarizabilities, yet allows intermolecular charge-transfer."
