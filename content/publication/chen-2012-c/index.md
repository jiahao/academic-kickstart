abstract: "A series of monoligated L·Pdᴵᴵ(Ar)X complexes (L = dialkyl biaryl phosphine) have been prepared and studied in an effort to better understand an unusual dearomative rearrangement previously documented in these systems. Experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a concerted process involving the unprecedented Pdᴵᴵ-mediated insertion of an aryl group into an unactivated arene."
